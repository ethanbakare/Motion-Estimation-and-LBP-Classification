INSTRUCTIONS:



0- Download the entire file 'code' to your local machine.

1- The file named 'Main_file2.m' is responsible for running Question 4 - 6, as all functions are calledinto this file

2- Each section within 'Main_file.m' possesses comments which act as guides to run the code

3- Within 'Main_file2.m' the lines of code marked with the comment
	
	"% -----	------	VALUE TO CHANGE"
	
   act as a guide showing where to change the values(such as: Window Size(WindowDim), Block Size(BlockDim) etc.) in 'Main_file' 
   for each section (where applicable)to get desired results and test the code

4 - Within 'Main_file2.m' each section is top commented with a question number


4- Question 4 works with one function files 'ICV_GetMotionDirect.m'(for obtaining the motion vectors)

5- Question 5 is written directly in the 'Main_file2.m' without any functions as it has a small number of code lines

6- Question 6 works with three function files 'ICV_Non_overlapping_Windows.m'(for windows of greyscale image) , 'ICV_LBP_Window.m'(for for windows of LBP image),
